### 0: thinking about abstraction【powerful tools for abstraction】

* inheritance and generics, which are largely about abstracting over data.

* Lambda expressions complement these by giving us a better tool for abstracting over behavior.

* embrace OOP and FP,use them together

  while it might seem that object-oriented programming and functional programming are competing disciplines, 
  they offer us complementary tools for managing program complexity. 
  and, as hardware parallelism continues to increase, the building blocks of functional programming【immutable values and pure functions】
  become even more effective tools for managing that complexity.
